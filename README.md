## Task : Expand Tic Tac Toe board size

This is a simple version of Tic Tac Toe, that you can play locally in the browser. Once you run the app, you can see that it is currently only supporting 3x3 version.

Now, as a player, I want to be able to choose the size of the board. The board will be still be square, with sizes like 5x5, 10x10, etc.
This means when I open the app, instead of seeing the game immediately, I want to see a "size" input and "start game" button.
Don't worry about the styling, a simple numeric input and button will suffice.

### `npm run start`
